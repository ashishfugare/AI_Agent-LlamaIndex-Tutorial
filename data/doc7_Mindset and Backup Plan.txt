### **doc7.txt — Mindset and Backup Plan**

Off-campus can be **brutal and rejection-heavy**. A balanced mindset ensures survival.

1. **Patience & Consistency:**

   * It may take 3–6 months of applying before success.
   * Rejections are not a reflection of capability, but timing.

2. **Backup Options:**

   * Higher Studies: MS (US/Europe), MBA (IIMs, ISB).
   * Freelancing: Web dev, AI/ML, backend engineering.
   * Startup: Build with IIT peers (risk but high reward).

3. **Continuous Learning:**

   * AI/ML, Cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure), Distributed Systems.
   * Stay updated with trends in fintech, AI, blockchain.

4. **Mental Health:**

   * Play sports, maintain hobbies, meditate.
