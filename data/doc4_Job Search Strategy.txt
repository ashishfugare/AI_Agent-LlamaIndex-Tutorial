### **doc4.txt — Job Search Strategy**

Off-campus recruitment = **structured hustle**.

1. **Referrals:**

   * Reach out to IIT alumni. Example DM: “Hi \[Name], I’m a CSE student from IIT \[campus]. I admire your journey and was wondering if you could provide guidance or a referral for \[role].”
   * Keep it short, polite, and professional.

2. **Platforms:**

   * **LinkedIn Jobs** → Filter by “Early Careers” or “0–2 years.”
   * **AngelList/Wellfound** → For startups with equity options.
   * **TripleByte** → Skills-based hiring.
   * **YC Work at a Startup** → Exposure to global startups.
   * **Company Career Pages** → Direct applications are underrated.

3. **Application Tracker:**

   * Use Notion/Excel with fields: `Company | Role | Date Applied | Referral | Status | Feedback`.
   * This prevents duplication and gives visibility on progress.

4. **Numbers Game:**

   * Apply to **at least 10 quality jobs per week**.
   * Expect a \~10% callback rate.
   * Focus on quality over mass applications.
