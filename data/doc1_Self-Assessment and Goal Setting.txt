**Self-Assessment and Goal Setting**

As an IIT Computer Science major preparing for an off-campus job with a high package, the first step is **self-assessment** and clear goal setting.

1. **Strengths:**

   * Strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, and computer science fundamentals.
   * Exposure to competitive programming through platforms like Codeforces and AtCoder.
   * Academic pedigree from IIT, which provides credibility in the job market.

2. **Weaknesses:**

   * Possible lack of industry-level project exposure compared to peers with big internships.
   * Communication and presentation skills may not be polished due to focus on technical academics.
   * Over-reliance on coding contests, with limited applied development experience.

3. **Role Preferences:**

   * Software Engineer (Backend/Full-Stack).
   * Data Engineer (for those strong in databases and pipelines).
   * ML Engineer (if coursework and projects align with AI/ML).

4. **Target Companies:**

   * Big Tech/Product: Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Stripe, Databricks, NVIDIA.
   * Scaled Startups: Cred, Razorpay, Zerodha, Zomato, Swiggy.
   * Global Startups via remote work: Deel, Notion, GitHub.

5. **SMART Goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound):**

   * Crack at least 3 Tier-1 product company interviews within 9 months.
   * Solve 500+ DSA problems before interviews.
   * Publish 2 technical blogs and 3 open-source contributions within 6 months.

> Self-assessment ensures clarity. Without knowing oneâ€™s strengths, weaknesses, and targets, random preparation leads to wasted effort.
