### **doc2.txt — Technical Skill Preparation**

For off-campus recruitment, **technical depth and breadth** make a candidate stand out.

1. **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA):**

   * Platforms: LeetCode, Codeforces, AtCoder.
   * Roadmap: Arrays → Strings → Linked Lists → Trees → Graphs → Dynamic Programming → Segment Trees → Advanced topics like Binary Indexed Trees, Flow Algorithms.
   * Goal: 500+ quality problems solved, covering patterns.
   * Example: “Solved 200+ medium and 50+ hard problems on LeetCode focusing on dynamic programming.”

2. **System Design (HLD & LLD):**

   * Study resources: “Grokking the System Design Interview,” Gaurav Sen’s YouTube series.
   * Practice problems: Design a URL shortener, messaging queue, distributed cache, load balancer.
   * Tools: Learn Docker, Kubernetes basics for modern system design awareness.

3. **Core CS Subjects:**

   * **Operating Systems:** Threads vs processes, memory management, scheduling algorithms.
   * **DBMS:** Indexing, transactions, normalization, ACID properties.
   * **Networks:** TCP vs UDP, OSI layers, HTTP/2, load balancing concepts.

4. **Projects:**
